Description
Although you guys have done Combination in lecture 7 before (right?), you all notice that a factorial of a large number may cause overflow even with type unsigned long(what a nightmare. We all have learnt that there is another definition of combination:

C(n, m) =

1, if m == 0 or m == n

C(n - 1, m - 1) + C(n - 1, m), otherwise

Please try to calculate the combination again with this definition.

Input
A line with two integers represent n and m respectively. (1 <= m <= n <= 30)

Output
An integer which represents C(n, m).
