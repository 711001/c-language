資訊系阿超正在協助可憐的銷售員設計即將到來的周年慶看板。

但是因為人工處理起來真的太費時了，

請幫她設計一個程式可以自動化的處理完這件任務吧!

別擔心，阿超知道要如何將輸出結果從螢幕終端顯示器中帶到現實的!

A-chao, from CSIE, is helping a poor supermarket salesperson designing the price tag for the upcoming anniversary event. However, there is way too much to do it by hand. Please help him design a program to print out the price tag format. Don't worry, he knows how to make things in the terminal become physical.

The following are the rules for each output lines:

Line #0 / #4: Filly Packed with the character "

Line #1: Start with a backslash \, four spaces, the discount percentage which takes 3 character lengths, the string %off!, four more spaces, then ends with another backslash.

Line #2: Start with a backslash \, one space, the string Before , two more spaces, a dollar sign $, the original cost without a decimal point using a field width of five characters (justified to the right), and ends with another space and a backslash.

Line #3: Start with a backslash \, one space, the string After, three more spaces, a dollar sign $, the discounted cost till the second decimal place using a field width of five characters (justified to the right), and ends with another space and a backslash.

No leading zero should be added to any of the printed numbers.

You can checkout the testing cases for full examples.

Input
Two integers a, b separated by a space.

a represents "discount percentage".

b represents "original cost".

0 <= a <= 100

1 <= b <= 99

Output
Consists of 5 lines, forming a 18*5 rectangle.

Please refer to the description section for details of each line.

Limits
Your program needs to finish task in 1 second.

Your program can only use memory less than 5000 KB.
