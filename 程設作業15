Description
Collatz conjecture, also known as 3n+1 problem, which is a conjecture in mathematics that is about a sequence defined as follows: Let S1 be a positive integer which is the start of the sequence, and

if Sn is even, then Sn+1 = Sn / 2

if Sn is odd, then Sn+1 = 3 * Sn + 1

The conjecture is that for any given positive integer S1 (<= 10^5), the sequence will reach 1.

e.g. Given S1 = 22, the sequence will be: 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

As students of NCKU, we are interested in this conjecture, please write a program to help us do some research in this conjecture.

Input
A positive integer S1, (1 <= S1 <= 10^5)

Output
Two integer L, M within a line, where L represents the length of the sequence and M is the maximum number of the sequence.
