Description
On the way back to the Skyland in an airship, crews face a huge attack from monsters. Willem falls out of the airship after several waves of attack, Chtholly notices that and wants to save him, please help her calculate how many meters remained before Willem reaches the ground. You may use the following equation to calculate the distance Willem has traveled through:Screenshot from 2021-10-13 13-54-46.png



Input
An integer h that indicates the height of the airship, 1000 <= h <= 10000

Output
The remained distance, in floating-point number, for each second until Willem reaches the ground, each occupies a line and is rounded to the first digit after the decimal point.
