Description
Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and are represented by seven different symbols:

Symbol: I, V, X, L, C, D, M

Value; 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000

For example, 6 is written as VI in Roman numerals, just 5 and 1 added together.

However, the numerals for 4 (IV) and 9 (IX) are written using "subtractive notation", where the first symbol (I) is subtracted from the larger one (V, or X), thus avoiding the clumsier (IIII, and VIIII). Subtractive notation is also used for 40 (XL) and 90 (XC), as well as 400 (CD) and 900 (CM). These are the only subtractive forms in standard use.

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

Input
An integer which is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Output
A Roman numeral representing the input integer.
