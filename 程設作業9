Description
In Taiwan, manufacturers of goods put a barcode on each product. This code identifies both the manufacturer and the product. Among a variety of different formats of the barcodes, one of these is known as EAN-13, which represents a thirteen-digit number. For example: 4 710367 663270.

The EAN-13 is composed of the following four components:

GS1 prefix: The first three digits usually identify the GS1 Member Organization which the manufacturer has joined.

Manufacturer code: This is a unique code (variable-length) assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix.

Product code: The product code, which immediately follows manufacturer code, is assigned by the manufacturer.

Check digit: This is an additional digit, used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly.

To calculate the check digit, follow the three steps below:

Numbering the positions from the right (exclude check digit), the odd positions in the twelve-digit number are weight of 3 and the even positions are weight of 1. Multiply each data digit with its corresponding weight.

For example:

data: 4 7 1 0 3 6 7 6 6 3 2 7

weight: 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3

Calculate the sum of the results from step 1.

Subtract the sum from the nearest multiple of 10 that is equal to or higher than the sum (see hint). The result is the check digit.

Write a program that calculate the check digit.
